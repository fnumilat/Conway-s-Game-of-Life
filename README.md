## About it:
I implemented the Conway's Game of Life in this Lambda School's Build Week project.

The users can use the Random option to randomly fill the cells and watch the generations changing and ending and also
they can use the 3 preset configurations that I have set up.

* Glider

## What other features does the app include?
* Play
* Pause
* Clear
* Speeds, (Fast and Slow)
* Grid Size, (Small, Original and Extra Large)

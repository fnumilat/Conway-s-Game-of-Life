## About it:
I implemented the Conway's Game of Life in this Lambda School's Build Week project.

## What do the users can do?
The users can use the Random option to randomly fill the cells and watch the generations changing and ending and also
they can use the 3 preset configurations that I have set up.

## What are the 3 preset configurations?
* Blinker
* Beacon
* Glider

## What other features does the app include?
* Generations(Showing the numbers of generations)
* Play(User can play)
* Pause(User can pause)
* Clear(User can clear the grid)
* Fast(Use can make the speed of the game fast)
* Slow(Use can make the speed of the game slow)
